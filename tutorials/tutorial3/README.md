# Object Tracking and Player Identification

## Understanding the Concept of Object Tracking
Object tracking involves identifying and following the movement of an object across multiple frames in a video. In the case of player tracking, YOLO tracks each bounding box across frames and assigns a consistent ID to each detected object.

- **Bounding Boxes**: Each player and object (such as the ball) is enclosed in a bounding box.
- **Frame-by-Frame Correlation**: The tracking algorithm associates the detected objects in consecutive frames, ensuring that each object retains its unique ID across the video.
- **Applications in Table Tennis**: Object tracking enables us to measure player movements, track the ball trajectory, and analyze in-game statistics.

## Using YOLO’s Tracking Capabilities
Instead of using YOLO for simple object detection, we utilize its built-in tracking feature to follow the movement of players across frames.

- We use **Ultralytics' YOLOv8X model**, which provides high accuracy.
- Instead of `predict()`, we use `track()` to maintain object IDs between frames.

```python
from ultralytics import YOLO

# Load pre-trained YOLOv8X model
model = YOLO('yolov8x.pt')

# Track objects in a video
result = model.track('input_file.mpg', conf=0.2, save=True)
```

- **`conf=0.2`**: Ensures that only detections with confidence above 20% are considered.
- **`save=True`**: Saves the output video with tracking annotations.
- Each player is assigned a **unique ID** that remains consistent across frames.

## Assigning Unique IDs to Players
Once tracking is applied, each detected player is assigned a unique identifier. This allows for:
- **Consistent player tracking** even when they move around the court.
- **Analysis of individual movements**, speeds, and distances covered.

By inspecting the output video, you will notice that each player has a **bounding box with an assigned ID**, helping to distinguish different players throughout the match.

## Applying Tracking to Table Tennis Player Movements
Tracking is particularly useful in table tennis, as it helps in:
- Identifying player positions in relation to the **court key points**.
- Measuring how much distance a player covers during a rally.
- Determining a player's **reaction time** and movement speed.

## Understanding the Benefits of Tracking for Table Tennis
By leveraging object tracking, we can gain valuable insights into player performance:
- **Shot Analysis**: Tracking the ball allows us to determine how often a player hits the ball.
- **Speed Measurement**: We can measure both **player speed** and **ball speed**.
- **Court Positioning**: By detecting the court key points, we can analyze player movement relative to the court.
- **In/Out Ball Detection**: Tracking the ball’s trajectory helps determine if a shot lands inside or outside the playing area.

### Next Steps
With tracking successfully implemented, the next phase involves integrating **ball tracking** using a fine-tuned YOLOv5 model and applying **deep learning techniques** to detect court boundaries and measure distances more accurately.
