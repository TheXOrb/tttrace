# Tutorial 2
Fine-Tuning the Ball Detection Model

## Understanding the need for fine-tuning.
## Finding or creating a table tennis ball dataset (Roboflow equivalent).
- Looking for a dataset in Roboflow from similar angles as in the video and I found this one
- https://universe.roboflow.com/madianou-kqrfk/table-tennis-ball-detection/dataset/1
- 
## Preparing the dataset for training.
## Training a custom YOLO model (YOLOv5) on the ball dataset.
## Evaluating and comparing the fine-tuned model's performance.
