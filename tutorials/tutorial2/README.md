# Tutorial 2
Fine-Tuning the Ball Detection Model

## Understanding the need for fine-tuning.
## Finding or creating a table tennis ball dataset (Roboflow equivalent).
## Preparing the dataset for training.
## Training a custom YOLO model (YOLOv5) on the ball dataset.
## Evaluating and comparing the fine-tuned model's performance.
