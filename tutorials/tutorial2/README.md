Fine-Tuning the Ball Detection Model

## Understanding the need for fine-tuning.
- As we saw in the video the table tennis ball was not detected in so many frames
- To get a higher sensitivity in the recognition we need to have a finetuned dataset especially for the table tennis ball
## Finding or creating a table tennis ball dataset (Roboflow equivalent).
- For this part you need an account on Roboflow - where you can download the dataset
- Looking for a dataset in Roboflow from similar angles as in the video and I found this one

## Preparing the dataset for training.
## Training a custom YOLO model (YOLOv5) on the ball dataset.
## Evaluating and comparing the fine-tuned model's performance.
