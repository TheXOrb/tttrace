# TTTrace
Table Tennis Trace - this is a repo inspired for AI/ML learning

## Objective 
Detect and track players and table tennis balls in a video.

## Features
- Detect table tennis table key points
- Measure player positions, distances, and speed
- Determine if the ball is in or out
- Count player shots and measure shot speed
- Train two convolutional neural networks (YOLO and custom CNN)

Building a Tennis Analysis Project from Scratch
I. Project Overview
Objective: Develop a system to automatically detect, track, and analyze tennis matches from video footage.

Key Features:

Object Detection: Accurate detection and tracking of players and tennis balls.
Court Analysis: Identification of key court points (lines, etc.) for precise positional data.
Metrics: Calculation of player speed, ball speed, shot distances, and shot count.
In/Out Determination: Assessment of whether a shot lands within or outside the court boundaries.
Model Training: Utilizes two Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs): YOLO for object detection and a custom CNN for court key point detection.
II. Project Setup
Input Data: A directory (input_videos) containing a sample image and video of a tennis match.

III. Object Detection with YOLO
Methodology: The project leverages the YOLOv8 object detection model via the Ultralytics library.

Implementation Steps:

Installation: pip install ultralytics
Model Loading: model = YOLO('yolov8x')
Prediction: results = model.predict(source='path/to/image.png', save=True)
Output Analysis: The results object provides bounding boxes, class labels, and confidence scores for each detected object.
Bounding Box Format: xyxy (x_min, y_min, x_max, y_max)

IV. Video Processing and Tracking
Challenges: Initial YOLO predictions struggle to accurately detect fast-moving tennis balls.

Solutions:

Model Fine-tuning: A custom YOLO model is trained on a Roboflow dataset specifically for tennis ball detection.
Object Tracking: Ultralytics' tracking functionality is used to maintain consistent object IDs across frames.
V. Court Key Point Detection
Methodology: A custom CNN (trained using PyTorch) is used to detect key points on the tennis court. This aids in accurate distance and position calculations.

Dataset: A dataset of tennis court images with annotated key points is used for training.

VI. Analysis and Visualization
Mini-Court Overlay: A scaled-down representation of the tennis court is overlaid on the video for clear visualization of player and ball positions.

Data Analysis: Algorithms are implemented to:

Calculate player speeds based on tracked positions and time intervals.
Calculate ball speeds between shots.
Determine the number of shots per player.
Final Output: The processed video includes overlaid bounding boxes, the mini-court visualization, and on-screen displays of calculated statistics (speeds, shot counts).

VII. Conclusion
This project demonstrates skills in computer vision, deep learning, and data analysis. It serves as a strong portfolio piece and can be further expanded upon. Future improvements could include:

More sophisticated shot analysis (e.g., shot type, placement).
Integration with scoring systems.
More robust handling of occlusions and challenging lighting conditions.
