# TTTrace - Table Tennis Trace: Video Analysis for Performance Metrics
Welcome to the TTTrace repository. TTTrace, short for Table Tennis Trace, is a project dedicated to analyzing table tennis player performance through video analysis. We're developing a system that uses computer vision and machine learning to trace and extract key performance metrics, such as player speed, ball shot speed, and shot counts.

This is a collaborative, hands-on project aimed at pushing the boundaries of sports analytics in table tennis. I initiated this project to deepen my understanding of machine learning and computer vision, and I'm now working with a team to expand its capabilities. We've integrated YOLO for robust object detection and are developing custom Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for precise table keypoint extraction.

## Objective 
Detect and track players and table tennis balls in a video.

## Features
- Detect table tennis table key points
- Measure player positions, distances, and speed
- Determine if the ball is in or out
- Count player shots and measure shot speed
- Train two convolutional neural networks (YOLO and custom CNN)
