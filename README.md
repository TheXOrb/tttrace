Table Tennis Trace - this is a repo inspired for AI/ML learning

## Tutorial 1
### Setting up the Environment and Basic Object Detection (Table Tennis Players and Ball):
- Installing necessary libraries (Ultralytics).
- Understanding YOLO and its basic usage.
- Running inference on a sample image and video.
- Analyzing the output (bounding boxes, confidence scores, class names).
- Adapting the model to table tennis.

## Tutorial 2
### Fine-Tuning the Ball Detection Model:
- Understanding the need for fine-tuning.
- Finding or creating a table tennis ball dataset (Roboflow equivalent).
- Preparing the dataset for training.
- Training a custom YOLO model (YOLOv5) on the ball dataset.
- Evaluating and comparing the fine-tuned model's performance.

## Tutorial 3
### Object Tracking and Player Identification:
- Understanding the concept of object tracking.
- Using YOLO's tracking capabilities.
- Assigning unique IDs to players.
- Applying tracking to table tennis player movements.
- Understanding the benifits of tracking for table tennis.

## Tutorial 4
### Court/Table Keypoint Detection (Using PyTorch):
- Understanding the importance of keypoint detection.
- Acquiring or creating a table keypoint dataset.
- Building a custom PyTorch dataset.
- Training a CNN (ResNet50) to detect keypoints.
- Understanding loss functions and optimizers.

## Tutorial 5
### Integrating Models and Calculating Metrics (Ball Speed, Player Movement):
- Combining the player detection, ball detection, and keypoint detection models.
- Calculating ball speed and player movement using detected data.
- Determining if the ball is "in" or "out" using keypoints.
- Calculating player coverage.

## Tutorial 6
### Advanced Analysis and Refinement:
- Analysing shot count, and shot speed.
- Refining the models for better accuracy.
- Visualizing the results.
- Exploring advanced analysis techniques (e.g., player positioning, shot patterns).
