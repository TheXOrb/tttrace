# TTTrace
Table Tennis Trace - this is a repo inspired for AI/ML learning

## Setting up the Environment and Basic Object Detection (Table Tennis Players and Ball):
- Installing necessary libraries (Ultralytics).
- Understanding YOLO and its basic usage.
- Running inference on a sample image and video.
- Analyzing the output (bounding boxes, confidence scores, class names).
- Adapting the model to table tennis.

## Fine-Tuning the Ball Detection Model:

## Object Tracking and Player Identification:

## Court/Table Keypoint Detection (Using PyTorch):

## Integrating Models and Calculating Metrics (Ball Speed, Player Movement):

## Advanced Analysis and Refinement:
